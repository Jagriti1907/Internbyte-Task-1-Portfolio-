This UI/UX design showcases a personal mobile portfolio application for Jagriti Singh, a UI/UX Designer. The design adopts a sleek, professional dark theme with vibrant accents (purple/pink/yellow) to highlight key information and create a modern aesthetic.
​The structure is based on five core screens, providing a complete user journey from introduction to contact:

Screen Design Focus Key Elements
Home/About (Initial View) Immediate impact and call-to-action. Clear profile image, role ("UI / UX Designer"), and direct buttons for "View My Work" and "More About Me."
About Me (Detail) In-depth professional philosophy. Concise mission statement ("...thrive on the challenge of the entire design process..."), and social media links.
Featured Work Highlighting key projects. Dedicated cards for significant projects like "Smart E-Learning" and "AR Application," with a clear "Know More" CTA.
My Skills Core competencies and expertise. Organized grid highlighting six specific professional areas (e.g., User Research & Strategy, Visual Design & Prototyping).
Contact Me Facilitating direct communication.

Overall Goal: To create a highly scannable, visually engaging, and functional mobile portfolio that effectively communicates the designer's skills and professional experience
